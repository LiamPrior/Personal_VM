Very Simple VM, Build in C, Only does 3 basic things atm. You can push an object to the stack with 'c',
You can display a single object with 'e' (once called it will iterate to the next object in on the stack), 
Finally you can halt the process with 'h' (Just palce at the end of test file)
Example can be found in hello.vm
